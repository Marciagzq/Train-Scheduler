####Overview
On this assignment, I was challenged to implement FIREBASE, to input, retrieve, erase and update data.
I also incorporate the format of Momentjs.com to display the time in a right format. 

####Requirements
* The app must meet the following specs:
    * When user adds trains, the admin should be able to submit the following:
        * Train Name
        * Destination
        * First Train Time
        * Frequency
    * Relative to the current time calculate the next train arrive.
    * Real Time date to view from different machines. 

    
####Bonus
* Be able to remove the data from the page and from the firebase.
* Upload the real time information for the different users.
